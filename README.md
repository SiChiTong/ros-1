# A Python-based Robot Operating System (ROS)

This provides a _Robot Operating System_ (ROS) for a Raspberry Pi based robot
written in Python 3, whose prototype hardware implementation is the KR01 robot.
Main communication between sensors and motor controller is performed over IÂ²C, 
using lever switch bumpers, Sharp/Pololu infrared distance sensors as well as 
a variety of Pimoroni sensors from the Breakout Garden series.

The KR01 robot uses the PiBorg ThunderBorg motor controller and UltraBorg 
ultrasonic sensor and servo controller board.

## Status

Currently the files have been copied into the repository from its initial local state. 
The individual files that have been posted to the repository function as advertised 
but the overall state of the ROS is not yet complete - there are still some pieces
missing that are not quite "ready for prime time."

The project is being exposed publicly so that those interested can follow its progress.
When things stabilise we'll update this status section.


## Installation

The ROS requires installation of a number of support libraries. In order to begin you'll
need Python3 and pip3, as well as the pigpio library.


## Support & Liability

This project comes with no promise of support or liability. Use at your own risk.


## Further Information

This project is part of the _New Zealand Personal Robotics (NZPRG)_ "Robot Operating
System", not to be confused with other "ROS" projects. For more information check out the
[NZPRG Blog](https://robots.org.nz/) and [NZPRG Wiki](https://service.robots.org.nz/wiki/).

Please note that the documentation in the code will likely be more current than this README file, so please consult it for the "canonical" information.
