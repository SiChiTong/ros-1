#  This starts top or htop (the system monitor) on a TFT display connected to
#  the Raspberry Pi, assuming it's connected as /dev/tty0. This uses a Python
#  subprocess so that the command executes and then returns.
#
#  This is kinda a work in progress, trying various approaches to see which
#  might be usable in a daemon capacity.
